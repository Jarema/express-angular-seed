express-angular-seed v. 0.1.0
====================

very simple and basic express4 and angular.js seed with ui-bootstrap

It is NOT a MEAN stack.
it uses:

new express 4 router stuff to create nice and easy to maintain routing,
bower to install angular, bootstrap, and rest


Ultimately with ready gruntfile, bower, and tests

should be ready in a few days
